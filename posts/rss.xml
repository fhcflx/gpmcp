      <description>&lt;h1 id="toc_0"&gt;What is neuro-oncology&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuro-oncology is the study of diagnosis and treatment of central nervous system tumors. As a medical specialty, it is exceedingly new, and very few specialized centers and training programs do exist in the world in this beginning of the 21st century. However, as a multidisciplinary field of interest and practice, it is pretty much old. Actually, trephining surgery for alleviating hydrocephalus, maybe related to brain tumors in some cases, were performed in the Neolithic, 7000 years BC. &lt;/p&gt;
